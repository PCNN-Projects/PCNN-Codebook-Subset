## Description
This repository contains a curated subset of the ontology-annotated codebook developed for the Post-COVID Network Netherlands (PCNN), as described in our MIE 2026 paper, "." The workflow harmonizes heterogeneous health data using ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC) and contextual suffixes, supporting FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). This subset demonstrates semantic mapping of variables across domains like demographics and patient-reported outcomes.
